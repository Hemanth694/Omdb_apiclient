# Omdb_apiclient
Omdb is an API which provides an access for movie database. By providing movie name and API key as a request we can get the details of a movie like movie title, IMDb id, Release year etc., as response. For this API I made an API client for accessing the movie database in a simpler manner.
In order to execute this task the user must download both python files and run the omdbengine.py file and give any movie name as the input.
Note- I have already provided the API key in the program itself
